An Oceanic Clearance is normally issued to an aircraft at least 30 minutes before they enter the Oceanic Control Area. An Oceanic Clearance contains three key elements: Route, usually the NAT / Routing across the North Atlantic Speed, your cruise speed in MACH (not IAS) Level, your cruise altitude as a Flight Level These elements serve to provide the three basic elements of separation: lateral, longitudinal, and vertical as early as possible since the controllers are controlling procedural airspace without any radar coverage. Further Information Oceanic Clearances are required for all flights within the Oceanic Controlled Airspace at or above FL55 (5500 ft). To assist the Oceanic Controllers in planning clearances efficiently and using airspace optimally, pilots requesting an oceanic clearance should notify the clearance controller of their highest possible altitude whenever possible at the oceanic boundary. Considering that the climb to the assigned oceanic flight level must be achieved before entering the oceanic airspace, this should generally be done while the aircraft is within radar controlled airspace such as Shannon or Moncton/Gander. In some airports close to the oceanic boundary such as Gander, Halifax, Moncton, Dublin & Shannon it may be necessary for a pilot to obtain their Oceanic Clearance on the ground. This is usually done to save time so that the pilot can fly straight to the boundary without the need to contact the clearance controller. However, pilots must make sure that they are already at their assigned parameters by the time they reach the oceanic boundary. After pilots obtain and read back their oceanic clearance, pilots should monitor their FIX estimate for oceanic entry. If if a change of 3 minutes or more is observed, the pilot must pass the revised estimate to ATC. This is done to recalculate your position in relation to other aircraft so that there is no conflict when entering the oceanic airspace. If a pilot has not received their Oceanic Clearance before entering the Oceanic Airspace, they must contact domestic ATC and request instructions to remain clear of the Oceanic Airspace until they receive their clearance. Aircraft must avoid entering Oceanic Airspace if a controller is online unless they have received their clearance. If in doubt, pilots should ask the Oceanic controller when they can expect their clearance. Each aircraft will be cleared to a specific flight level and Mach number. If a pilot cannot accept a certain level or Mach number they must report it to ATC and provide their available options so that ATC can best accommodate. Workflow from start to finish The following section will explain each element of the clearance exchange. A pilot should call up the Oceanic Controller first to establish initial contact and to make the controller aware that the pilot is looking to request their oceanic clearance. BAW123: Gander Radio, BAW123, request oceanic clearance. CZQX_FSS : BAW123, Gander Radio, pass your message Once the Oceanic Controller has given the \u201cpass your message\u201d or \u201cgo ahead\u201d instruction, BAW123 may now request their oceanic clearance. In the request, the following must be included: Destination airport Requested NAT Track Estimate for the NAT / Oceanic Airspace entry in ZULU time Requested Mach number Requested flight level, and maximum flight level if able ('When Able Higher' report) With all their information collated, BAW123 may now go ahead and request their oceanic clearance: BAW123: Gander Radio, BAW123 request Oceanic Clearance to London Heathrow via Track Alpha. Estimating ALLRY at 1240 zulu. Requesting Flight Level 350, able Flight Level 370. Mach .80 The controller will acknowledge the pilot's request and will tell BAW123 to standby. When the controller is ready, the clearance is issued: CZQX_FSS : Gander Oceanic clears BAW123 London Heathrow via ALLRY, track Alpha. From ALLRY maintain Flight Level 350, Mach .80 BAW123 must, in the readback of their clearance, confirm that their version of the NAT track message is up-to-date by including the TMI (see North Atlantic Tracks ): BAW123: BAW123 is cleared to London Heathrow, via NAT track Alpha, TMI 115. From ALLRY maintain Flight Level 350, Mach .80 When BAW123 has made a correct readback, the controller will confirm that the readback was correct and will instruct the pilot to \u201creturn to domestic frequency\u201d or to \u201creturn to previous frequency\u201d. CZQX_FSS: BAW123, read-back correct, return to previous frequency. For aircraft requesting random routings through Shanwick/Gander OCAthe whole random routing must be included in the request, including all coordinates and the entry/exit fixes. Pilots are additionally required to read back the full route issued by the controller. \u2018Cleared as filed\u2019 is not an available phrase. Below are some more possible examples.

Let's talk about communication. Most VATSIM pilots are used to the \"Clear, Crisp, Ultra HD\" communication over the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio used in most domestic ATC zones, and is the primary technology used to facilitate Air-Ground-Air (AGA) communication. Whilst the clarity and reliability of VHF transmissions makes them ideal for AGA communication use, the technology's reliance on \u2018line-of-sight\u2019 (just like radar) makes it virtually impossible to communicate with aircraft beyond 250-280 NM. This isn't nearly enough range to cover the entire ocean. Even if it was decided to station remote ships fitted with VHF receivers in the middle of the ocean, the cost and lack of efficiency would grossly outweigh the benefit. For most populated areas around the world, where it is possible to install numerous radio transceivers on land, this limitation is not a factor. However, over the oceans and throughout very remote areas of the world, building a network of VHF transceivers is very difficult, if not impossible. An alternative solution is therefore required. The answer is found through the use of High Frequency (HF) radio. Even with the development of satellite and datalink technology, the reliability of HF means that it remains the predominant method of establishing communication with ATC over remote areas. Audio For VATSIM (AFV) Implementation Whilst most default and add-on aircraft can replicate realistic VHF radio operation, HF, on the other hand, is a bit tricky. It is technically possible to simulate proper HF tuning on VATSIM, however many aircraft simply cannot tune an HF radio. With that being said, a workaround has been devised. Instead of the pilot tuning directly to an HF frequency, the pilot tunes a regular VHF frequency which AFV parses into an HF frequency. How cool is that? Until it is possible to simulate proper HF radio operation, the alias method will be used to enable the HF experience over the network. On VATSIM, there actually isn't much of a difference between VHF and HF (yet! more realistic simulation is planned). The presence of far more static is really the only difference, but it is a key one as it can make communication quite difficult at times. Like VHF, the further away you fly from the receiver location, the less clarity there will be in radio transmissions. Propagation of High-Frequency Radio Waves HF utilises a lower frequency band (3 MHz to 30 MHz) than VHF. Frequencies in this band have longer wavelengths than those in the VHF band. As a result, instead of continuing in a straight line, through the atmosphere and into space, the waves can be reflected by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, allowing for \u2018over the horizon\u2019 communication. This allows communication via HF to be effective over extremely long ranges, as far as 8,000 NM or even further under ideal conditions. Transmissions over HF are able to \u2018skip\u2019 across the ionosphere, enabling \u2018over the horizon\u2019 communication. HF radio waves can propagate as 'ground waves' or \u2018sky waves\u2019. Ground waves are received over shorter distances closer to the transmitter. Sky waves, on the other hand, can travel far greater distances. At the longer wavelengths used in HF communication, the waves can interact with the ionosphere, an electrically-charged layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The waves bounce directly off the ionosphere and back towards the ground. The signal is often reflected multiple times, \u2018skipping\u2019 between the surface of the Earth and the ionosphere, and as a result, the waves can propagate many thousands of miles. An analogy to understand this is the idea of skipping a stone across water, at the right angle, the stone bounces off the surface of the water and back into the air, often several times. The maximum range for HF radio waves is heavily dependent upon atmospheric conditions, the angle at which the signal meets the ionosphere and the frequency of the radio wave. For example, at night, the ionosphere is generally lower than during the day. This means that the angle at which the radio waves make contact with it is shallower and therefore they can skip further. Sky waves can skip several times to cover extremely large distances. The frequency of the radio wave also plays an important role. As a general rule of thumb, higher frequencies (10-30 MHz) work better during the day, and lower frequencies (2-10 MHz) work better at night. The Incessant Static Naturally with the nature of HF radio propagation, there is a propensity to pick up a level of atmospheric interference. The more bounces the wave performs, the more interference that can occur. This is why HF can be very noisy. The Future of Oceanic Communication In recent years, HF has been put under the spotlight. Whilst HF is very reliable, it is noisy, as mentioned, and alternatives to the technology have been explored. One of these solutions has been CPDLC (Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication). Using CPDLC, a pilot can compose text messages and communicate with the controller without using the radio. CPDLC has become a very viable solution in many areas of the world as an alternative to voice communication in non-urgent situations. ADS-B/ADS-C is another solution that has largely superseded the need for voice position reporting. Currently, a combination of ADS-C and Space-Based ADS-B is used to provide regular, real-time aircraft position updates as well as event-based updates (e.g. aircraft is climbing; aircraft is leaving designated route), as fast as every seven seconds. Because of this, on the VATSIM network, aircraft that do have an ADS-B or ADS-C equipment are not required to provide position reports, however, they are more than welcome to do so if the controller workload permits them to do so! Tips for using High-Frequency Radio Most of the time, you will be communicating with the controllers via the radio, but as mentioned, communicating with the controllers can be a bit tricky. Here are some tips to help you out. Speak slowly on the frequency - both the controller and yourself hear the same transmission quality and speaking at a lower rate ensures that the controller has the best chance of understanding you. Sometimes the controller will need to write down elements of your transmission and a slower transmission assists them greatly Depress your Push-To-Talk (PTT) button fully before speaking, however, do not depress your PTT until you are ready to speak Avoid turning your head away from the microphone, and aim to keep the distance between your mouth and the microphone the same whilst speaking Use a normal conversation volume; there is no need to speak any louder Speak clearly and evenly A slight pause before and after any numbers will make them easier to understand Avoid including unnecessary words or phrases in your message (as well as hesitations such as \u201cerr\u201d, \u201cuhh\u201d, etc.); the more concise the transmission, the better. A good rule of thumb is: if the transmission still conveys your message after you leave a particular word out, then the word should not be in the transmission Avoid excessive use of courtesies, and avoid entering into non-operational conversations over the radio Keep in mind that the controller's native language may not be English \u2013 speak clearly and use standard radiotelephony (RTF) words and phrases wherever possible Messages should not contain more than three specific phrases, comprising a clearance, instruction, and any pertinent information. In many cases, the controller may pass each phrase separately to reduce the possibility of a misunderstanding Do not release the PTT button until after you have completely finished speaking to avoid \u2018clipping\u2019 the end of your transmission When transmitting a message, it is a good idea to say your callsign twice and wait for the controller to respond before passing your full request. This ensures the controller is ready to receive your transmission and knows exactly where it is coming from Most importantly of them all!

Previously, given the lack of radar coverage over the North Atlantic, controllers had to resort to other methods to work out aircraft position. Nowadays, with the widespread surveillance coverage provided by ADS-B and ADS-C surveillance technologies, the 'no-radar' problem has largely been solved in the real world. However, there are still many aircraft - especially on VATSIM that are not equipped with ADS-B or ADS-C equipment. This is where position reports come in. Many routes over the North Atlantic define designated \u2018reporting points\u2019; points at which a pilot must report their position. However, for routes without designated reporting points, then a report must be sent at every significant point, or every ten degrees of longitude, whichever is more often. If the estimate provided to ATC for the waypoint immediately following the current reporting point has changed by three minutes or more, a revised estimate must be transmitted to the appropriate controller as soon as possible. Pilots must always report to ATC when reaching new flight levels, and optionally when leaving the old flight level.

Listening to this background static for a whole six-hour flight would be distracting and difficult, so Selective Calling (or SELCAL) was devised so that pilots can turn down their noisy radios. How does it work? Many aircraft are assigned a four-letter \u2018SELCAL code\u2019 enabling them to make use of the system. When a ground operator wishes to communicate with an aircraft, they enter the aircraft's SELCAL code into an encoder which converts each letter into a designated audio tone. The converted tones are broadcast over the radio frequency and are received and interpreted by a decoder on the aircraft's radio receiver, and if the tones match the aircraft's assigned code, then the crew is alerted by a chime, a light, or both. This gives the crew enough time to turn up their radios and receive the transmission from the operator. Image source: VATSIM New Zealand Can I choose any code Not quite. The SELCAL system supports sixteen characters from the Latin alphabet (letters A through S , excluding I , N and O ) and the characters are written/transmitted in alphabetical order as two ordered pairs of characters. For example, the code AB-CD is valid, as well as CD-AB , however, BA-CD and DC-BA are not. Each letter in any given code must be unique, so both AA-BC and AC-CD are invalid. Can I use SELCAL on VATSIM? SELCAL is simulated on VATSIM by all major pilot clients. Simply enter your SELCAL code and connect!

It might seem daunting at first, but this vast stretch of ocean isn't all that hard to master, and we're glad that you're interested in the world of oceanic flight! \"But surely oceanic can't be that different to domestic?\" Well, yes and no. In many areas, there are similarities, though the nature of the airspace makes it hard to conduct domestic-like operations. Let's dive into some of the key differences. No Primary or Secondary Radar?! Nope! Controllers cannot use radar to work out where you are. There is simply nowhere to place a radar antenna in the vastness of the North Atlantic. Instead, in this \u2018procedural airspace\u2019, the oceanic controllers rely on reports from you, the pilot. Nowadays, these reports are often automatically generated using a combination of ADS-C and Space-Based ADS-B equipment on the aircraft which automatically send updated position reports to oceanic controllers which allows controllers to use reduced separation minima across the ocean. However, we still rely on position reports for aircraft that lack ADS-B and ADS-C equipment (see Position Reporting ). No such luxury! Why is it so hard to understand what the oceanic controller is saying? On top of the lack of radar, there is the problem of long-range communication. As with radar, VHF (Very High-Frequency) radio is line-of-sight, which becomes an issue after an aircraft disappears over the horizon into the vastness of the North Atlantic skies. Therefore, a radio technology is needed that does not rely on line-of-sight and the solution to this is HF (High Frequency) radio. By its nature, HF radio is very noisy and does not have the same clarity as VHF radio, and thus it can sometimes be difficult to understand the oceanic controller. Quick tips: If you didn't understand what the controller said, ask them to repeat it or explain it differently. Asking the controller to clarify what they meant is a lot easier than trying to wrap your head around a transmission that you didn't understand. Speak slowly and clearly! Oceanic controllers use the same noisy frequency, and they need you to make it easy for them to understand your transmissions too. Speak your callsign twice, sometimes the controller may miss it the first time due to the static and it can be handy to reduce the overall amount of time on the radio.

It sounds a bit silly to receive another clearance, but in fact, this \u2018Oceanic Clearance\u2019 (see Getting Your Clearance ) is the most important element of your flight. We discussed the nature of \u2018procedural airspace\u2019 earlier on, and another consequence of this particular oceanic quirk is the increased requirement of separation. Oceanic controllers can't employ the same minima as they would in a domestic environment, and by the time they detect a conflict between two aircraft, it may be too late. To minimise the risk of any conflict during an aircraft's crossing, the Oceanic Clearance is used to separate aircraft from the very point they enter the airspace. Ideally, with the right clearance, there should be no need for a controller to make an emergency correction whilst the aircraft is inside the airspace. Of course, in reality, this is sometimes necessary, no pilot or controller is perfect, however with the help of technology controllers can minimise and detect risks more efficiently than ever before.

With so many nuances and procedures that are different from domestic flight, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. However, with enough practice, it is an immensely gratifying skill and a tool that you can add to your VATSIM arsenal. In this article, we will outline the basics of oceanic flight planning and some tips and tricks you can take advantage of to perform a successful oceanic flight. Routes In the previous article (see NAT Tracks ) we discussed the two main types of oceanic routing, NAT Track and Random Routing. However, which one do you choose? As discussed, eastbound and westbound flight on the OTS are only available at certain times of the day. Much of the time, it will be possible to utilise a NAT track, and if this is the case, then it should be the preferred option, however, there are many situations where a published track is simply not available for a pilot's direction of flight and/or requirements. Therefore, a Random Routing is required. Many flight planning tools such as SimBrief generate a suitable Random Routing, however, at times, it may be necessary to make one up. In that case, observe the high-level weather forecast and plot a logical route, for example, select a waypoint every 10 degrees of longitude. Flight Levels Each of the NAT tracks has a published set of specific flight levels allocated between the FL310 and FL400 band. This makes altitude choice relatively easy for a designated track. Random Routings, however, have their own set of flight levels depending on direction of flight. These are summarised in the below table: Level Time Direction FL430 All Westbound FL410 All Eastbound FL400 All Westbound FL390 All Eastbound FL380 0801z-2229z 2230z-0800z Westbound Eastbound FL370 All Eastbound FL360 All Westbound FL350 All Eastbound FL340 0801z-2229z 2230z-0800z Westbound Eastbound FL330 1901z-0959z 1000z-1900z Eastbound Westbound FL320 All Westbound FL310 All Westbound FL300 All Westbound FL290 All Eastbound Mach Number Instead of Indicated Airspeed (IAS), Mach is used in oceanic airspace. Mach is very important for aircraft operating at high levels at high speed, as it is a better representation of the aircraft's actual speed through the air than ground speed or IAS at cruising levels. Pilots may file their preferred Mach number and in most cases will receive a clearance with that Mach number. It is rare for a controller to assign anything more than .02 Mach below or .01 Mach above the requested speed. Speed in oceanic airspace is measured in \u201cMach\u201d, which ratio between the aircraft's true airspeed (TAS) and the speed of sound. Other General Tips If you don't understand what the controller said, say so! They will explain it to you in a different way. Likewise, if you cannot do something, tell them that you are \u2018unable\u2019 and they can find an alternative. If you are not sure about any aspect of your oceanic flight, don't be afraid to private message the oceanic controller. More often than not, they will be more than happy to help you out. If you need something from the controller, for example, a change of flight level or a change of speed, just ask! In many cases, the controller can accommodate the request.

As a result of these flows, most traffic is concentrated uni-directionally depending on the time of day. Peak westbound traffic crosses 30W between 1130z and 1900z, whilst peak eastbound traffic crosses 30W between 0100z and 0800z. On top of these operational characteristics, wind, airline requests and controller separation requirements play essential roles. Aircraft typically need to fly between a narrow level band (between FL310 and FL400) and will attempt to fly with the strongest tailwind (eastbound crossing) or will try to avoid the headwind (westbound crossing). All of these considerations prompt the need for a system of dynamic routes across the North Atlantic. This system is known as the Organised Track System, or OTS for short. Each day, the OTS is constructed with the cooperation of all relevant OACCs (Oceanic Area Control Centres) to ensure that the best possible routes are chosen for the conditions. The agreed OTS for the day is then forwarded through the \u2018NAT track message\u2019. The NAT track message details all of the agreed-upon North Atlantic routings for the flow and messages are typically published twice a day, at 2200z and 1400z.

Instead, \u2018coordinate points\u2019 are used, often formatted as 50/30, translating as 50 North, 30 West. Each message is issued a TMI (Track Message Identifier), which is simply the current Julian calendar day (up to 365, assuming non-leap year). In situations where an amendment needs to be made, a letter is appended to the end of the TMI (e.g. 123A), and the message is re-issued. It is important to clarify the TMI in all clearance readbacks, as it is possible to have received an outdated NAT message by mistake. It Takes Five to Tango Five routes exist in the far south-east corner of Shanwick's airspace to connect routes between Shannon's SOTA area and Spain, the Canaries and the Lisbon FIR. These routes do not change daily and are known as the \u2018Tango Routes\u2019 or \u2018T Routes\u2019 for short. T9: provides a north/south route connecting airways routing between the west of the Portuguese Coast to eastbound routings across the north of Spain. T9 connects SOTA to the Madrid FIR between LASNO and BEGAS. This Tango Route is uni-directional and can only be received by southbound flight. T213 : also connects SOTA to the Madrid FIR routing TAMEL and BERUX, forming more limited connections to the western edge of the Lisboa FIR and several southbound routes through Spain towards Tunisia. This Tango Route is bi-directional. T16: connects SOTA to the Canaries, routing OMOKO and GONAN. This Tango Route is uni-directional, and can only be received by southbound flight T13: sister to T16, routing OMOKO and NILAV. This Tango Route is uni-directional, and can only be received by northbound flight T290: new as of 30th Jan 2020, connecting SOTA to the Madrid FIR, routing GELPO and ADVAT. This Tango Route is uni-directional and can only be received by southbound flight. Note: Expect to hear the waypoints for these routes individually read out in the clearance to reduce the chance of a misunderstanding. The Tango (T) Routes What about Concorde? Even though the Concorde hasn't been seen in the real-world skies since 2003, pilots looking for a nostalgia kick might want to dust off their Concorde on the network. Therefore, the three legacy Concorde tracks remain available for use today on the network. Unlike regular NAT tracks, these tracks are static and did not change daily because the Concorde's high cruising altitude (between FL550 and FL600) meant that the aircraft flew above most weather systems that impact normal NAT track selection. Let's have a look at these routes.

In situations where an amendment needs to be made, a letter is appended to the end of the TMI (e.g. 123A), and the message is re-issued.

Therefore, the three legacy Concorde tracks remain available for use today on the network.

Navigation and clearance mistakes are sometimes made (sometimes big mistakes) that result in aircraft flying at unintended flight levels, or as far as one degree off track. Can't modern-day technology help fix navigation errors? Ironically, the precision of modern navigation technology, designed to decrease the likelihood of navigation errors, can present additional navigation hazards. This is known as the 'navigation paradox' - the increased accuracy of navigation technology increases the risk of a mid-air collision. This is due to the ability for aircraft to fly so precisely along a defined route, that the likelihood of two aircraft occupying the same area in the sky is greatly increased. Over an area serviced by VHF radio, a controller can intervene relatively quickly to avoid a collision, but over areas where VHF is not possible and controllers rely on HF, CPDLC and SATVOICE, there can be a considerable delay between detection and action given the communication challenges. Without any randomness, the potential for an accident is uncomfortably high, so it was determined that by encouraging aircraft to fly random route offsets, an additional safety margin would be provided and the risk of a mid-air conflict would be dramatically mitigated. The application of this technique is defined in a set of procedures known as the Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (or affectionately, SLOP). So, how do I use SLOP? SLOP defines the following guidelines: aircraft may fly offsets to the right of their designated route up to a maximum of 2 NM; and offsets to the left of the route are not permitted SLOP is permitted only to the right of a path, not to the left. The discretion offered to pilots in defining their offsets provides a large margin of safety and as such, SLOP is now a Standard Operating Procedure for the entire NAT region. Flight crews are required to adopt the procedures as available and appropriate. A few things to note: Aircraft not capable of programming automatic offsets must fly their designated route on the centreline. Aircraft capable of automatic offset programming should randomly select between an offset or the centreline. To determine the best path to fly, a flight crew should use their appropriate equipment (radio, visual observations, TCAS/ACAS, GPWS) to determine which flight path is best. AIrcraft capable of programming offsets in tenths of a nautical mile should do so, as it contributes further to collision mitigation.

Here you can start to request clearance and also see a history of recent messages. Click Request Oceanic Clearance . You will be presented with a reminder regarding timing and the like. Click through via the big blue button saying Request Clearance. Filling out the form You should see a form asking for your flight details. Section 1 - Callsign, destination, level, speed The first section of the form asks for your callsign, destination, requested flight level, maximum flight level, and requested mach speed. Callsign: Your callsign as per your VATSIM connection. For Cross the Pond, this should be the callsign you booked with unless you had to change it. natTrak will attempt to detect this for you. Destination ICAO: The ICAO code of your final destination airport, EGLL for example. natTrak will attempt to detect this for you. Requested flight level: The flight level you wish to fly during your crossing. For Cross the Pond, this must be the flight level that was allocated to you in your booking details. Type this as three digits, for example FL420 will be 420. Maximum flight level: The highest possible flight level you can fly at the beginning of your oceanic crossing. This is generally given to you in your aircraft's VNAV FMC page. Example on right side of page (courtesy Flight Simulation Association CTP Pilot Briefing Webinar, March 27 2022 ). Requested mach number: The mach number you are requesting to fly during your crossing. Type this as three digits beginning with 0. For example, mach .81 will be 081. Section 2 - Routeing Here you can specify whether you are requesting a NAT Track, or a random routeing. The tracks dropdown will display the current active NAT tracks available. Select the one you are requesting. Leave the random routeing box blank. If you are flying a random routeing, paste it into the second box. Select None on the tracks dropdown. Section 3 - Oceanic entry Here you enter the oceanic entry point (typically the first waypoint on your track/random routeing) and your calculated estimate of arriving at that waypoint. It is critical that you use real world time for the estimate. For example, if you are flying track A routeing by PIKIL 56/20 57/30 57/40 55/50 LOMSI , your entry fix will be PIKIL . Your estimate for arriving at PIKIL can be found in your FMS providing your simulator is set to real time.

They are: Not Ready - student has been accepted, still hasn't submitted their availability Ready For Pick-Up - student has submitted their times, or the student has not got an assigned instructor In Progress - student is assigned and training is underway Solo Certification - student has an active solo certification (assigned in conjunction with In Progress) Ready For Assessment - student is recommended by Instructor for assessment (assigned without In Progress) Completed - student has passed assessment and has completed training Inactive - student should be placed for removal To assign a label, click the plus icon next to their status labels on their profile. You will be presented with a dialog asking you to pick the label. To remove a label, hover over the label until you get a red mark next to it. Click the label to remove it. You cannot remove a label if it is the only one assigned to the student. Recommendations You can recommend your student be given a Solo Certification and be sent for assessment. These buttons are visible on their student profile. To issue a recommendation, click the respective button. It will send an email notification to all Assessors with your recommendation. They will communicate with you their course of action. These buttons will be greyed out if the student is already on a solo cert or is marked ready for assessment, respectively. Finishing their training When an Assessor has marked a student as having passed their OTS, they will need to create a training note with their assessment report. Eventually, this will be done through marking their OTS Session as Passed.","title":"Training admin guide"}]}
