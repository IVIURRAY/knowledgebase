# SELCAL
<p>One of the disadvantages of High-Frequency Radio, as discussed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://knowledgebase.ganderoceanic.com/atc/hf-radio">previous page</a>, is the incessant white noise. Listening to this background static for a whole six-hour flight would be distracting and difficult, so Selective Calling (or SELCAL) was devised so that pilots can turn down their noisy radios.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Many aircraft are assigned a four-letter ‘SELCAL code’ enabling them to make use of the system. When a ground operator wishes to communicate with an aircraft, they enter the aircraft's SELCAL code into an encoder which converts each letter into a designated audio tone. The converted tones are broadcast over the radio frequency and are received and interpreted by a decoder on the aircraft's radio receiver, and if the tones match the aircraft's assigned code, then the crew is alerted by a chime, a light, or both. This gives the crew enough time to turn up their radios and receive the transmission from the operator.</p>

## Can I choose any code
<p>Not quite. The SELCAL system supports sixteen characters from the Latin alphabet (letters&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>through&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>, excluding&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>N&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>) and the characters are written/transmitted in alphabetical order as two ordered pairs of characters. For example, the code&nbsp;<strong>AB-CD&nbsp;</strong>is valid, as well as&nbsp;<strong>CD-AB</strong>, however,&nbsp;<strong>BA-CD&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>DC-BA</strong>&nbsp;are not. Each letter in any given code must be unique, so both&nbsp;<strong>AA-BC</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>AC-CD</strong>&nbsp;are invalid.</p>
<h2>Can I use SELCAL on VATSIM?</h2>
<p>SELCAL is simulated on VATSIM by all major pilot clients. Simply enter your SELCAL code and connect! On initial contact with ATC, you can request a ‘SELCAL check’ so that the controller knows that you are SELCAL-capable.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ACA123</strong>: Gander Radio, Air Canada 123 request SELCAL check on FS-BQ (Foxrot Sierra Bravo Quebec)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CZQX_FSS</strong>: Air Canada 123, Gander Radio, stand by for SELCAL check.</p>
