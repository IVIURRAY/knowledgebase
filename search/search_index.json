This shows your requests and replies to them from ATC. You can see the oceanic clearance request as done on the last page. It is presented in the datalink format similar to CPDLC. PIKIL/1033 refers to an entry waypoint of PIKIL , with an estimate time of reaching of 10:33 zulu. Track A is the track you requested, replaced with the random routeing if you requested that instead. F350 M083 refers to your requested flight level and mach speed. MAX F390 is the maximum flight level you specified. Receiving an oceanic clearance Your oceanic clearance when issued will be automatically presented on the page when it is issued. Get notified when it arrives When you go onto the page for the first time, your browser should ask if you wish to receive notifications from nattrak.vatsim.net (screenshot is in development environment). If you allow it, you should be notified via a browser push notification when your clearance is available providing you leave the page open in the background. The clearance will appear as so: You can see both a datalink and voice clearance format. The datalink format is as follows: CLX 0629 270322 NAT CLRNCE 15 Oceanic clearance at 06:29Z, date 27/03/22, from NAT (bandbox EGGX/CZQO) oceanic controller, number 15 in sequence of the day. BAW14LA CLRD TO KJFK VIA PIKIL You're cleared to KJFK via PIKIL, your entry waypoint. NAT A your NAT track/random routeing. PIKIL 56/20 57/30 57/40 55/50 LOMSI The track routeing. FM PIKIL/1033 MNTN F350 M083 From PIKIL (estimating arrival at 10:33Z), maintain FL350, mach .83. The voice format below that represents the usual voice formats as per Getting Your Clearance . Restrictions and changes Sometimes ATC may issue a restriction on your clearance or change an element of it for traffic or separation reasons. For example: In this scenario, Santa Maria (LPPO) has issued you a clearance but with several changes/restrictions. Of course usually there wouldn't be so many! /ATC CROSS PIKIL NOT BEFORE 1035 ATC needs you to cross PIKIL not before 10:35z. You could adjust your mach speed or request instructions from your current domestic sector to achieve this. /ATC MACH CHANGED or /ATC FLIGHT LEVEL CHANGED ATC has changed your crossing mach speed and/or flight level. Check the FM PIKIL/1033 MNTN F340 M082 line above - it will contain your new flight level and/or mach number. /ATC ** RECLEARANCE 0634 ** This represents ATC reissuing your clearance if they had already previously issued another one. Acknowleding your clearance and reverting to voice There is no requirement to acknowledge oceanic clearances on natTrak, unlike on voice. If needed, ATC may reject your oceanic clearance request via natTrak and contact you asking to request via voice. Expect a private message via your pilot client. I haven't got my clearance in 15 or more minutes?! Talk to your domestic controller if they're online, otherwise contact the oceanic controller. They may have missed your message. Need more help?

As with all oceanic clearances , be sure to submit your request at least 30 minutes prior to entry. If you submit it via natTrak less than 15 minutes prior to entry, it will be automatically rejected and you will need to revert to voice operations. Accessing the oceanic clearance request page After you have logged in with your VATSIM account and providing you are an active pilot, you will see this dropdown menu on the home page. Here you can start to request clearance and also see a history of recent messages. Click Request Oceanic Clearance . You will be presented with a reminder regarding timing and the like. Click through via the big blue button saying Request Clearance. Filling out the form You should see a form asking for your flight details. Section 1 - Callsign, destination, level, speed The first section of the form asks for your callsign, destination, requested flight level, maximum flight level, and requested mach speed. Callsign: Your callsign as per your VATSIM connection. For Cross the Pond, this should be the callsign you booked with unless you had to change it. natTrak will attempt to detect this for you. Destination ICAO: The ICAO code of your final destination airport, EGLL for example. natTrak will attempt to detect this for you. Requested flight level: The flight level you wish to fly during your crossing. For Cross the Pond, this must be the flight level that was allocated to you in your booking details. Type this as three digits, for example FL420 will be 420. Maximum flight level: The highest possible flight level you can fly at the beginning of your oceanic crossing. This is generally given to you in your aircraft's VNAV FMC page. Example on right side of page (courtesy Flight Simulation Association CTP Pilot Briefing Webinar, March 27 2022 ). Requested mach number: The mach number you are requesting to fly during your crossing. Type this as three digits beginning with 0. For example, mach .81 will be 081. Section 2 - Routeing Here you can specify whether you are requesting a NAT Track, or a random routeing. The tracks dropdown will display the current active NAT tracks available. Select the one you are requesting. Leave the random routeing box blank. If you are flying a random routeing, paste it into the second box. Select None on the tracks dropdown. Section 3 - Oceanic entry Here you enter the oceanic entry point (typically the first waypoint on your track/random routeing) and your calculated estimate of arriving at that waypoint. It is critical that you use real world time for the estimate. For example, if you are flying track A routeing by PIKIL 56/20 57/30 57/40 55/50 LOMSI , your entry fix will be PIKIL . Your estimate for arriving at PIKIL can be found in your FMS providing your simulator is set to real time. An example on an Airbus MCDU is provided on the right (courtesy Flight Simulation Association CTP Pilot Briefing Webinar, March 27 2022 ). Section 4 - TMI, free text Enter the current TMI (see NAT Tracks for details). For Cross the Pond this may be different from the current real world one - check the menu bar on the top of the page for the current one. You can also enter free text if you wish. Use this for extra details or the like. You can now submit the form using the blue button. If there are errors in your input, you will be redirected back to the form and shown what to fix. What now? You should be presented with your message history page with your request details. Continue reading on this page for more details! Need more help?
